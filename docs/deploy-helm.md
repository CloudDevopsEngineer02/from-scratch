# Deploy Helm

Install [helm](https://helm.sh) client locally on your system by following [these instructions](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm), then initialize `helm` in the cluster:

```
$ helm version --client
Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.9.0", GitCommit:"f6025bb9ee7daf9fee0026541c90a6f557a3e0bc", GitTreeState:"clean"}

$ helm init
$HELM_HOME has been configured at /Users/geese/.helm.

Tiller (the Helm server-side component) has been installed into your Kubernetes Cluster.

Please note: by default, Tiller is deployed with an insecure 'allow unauthenticated users' policy.
For more information on securing your installation see: https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#securing-your-helm-installation
Happy Helming!
```
That created a `tiller-deploy` deployment in the `kube-system` namespace which deployed a single `tiller` pod:

```
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system
NAME                                   READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
heapster-555f7f75b6-vcz4p              1/1       Running   0          10d
kube-dns-68886d5985-sht75              3/3       Running   0          10d
kubernetes-dashboard-5b575fd4c-v48qb   1/1       Running   0          10d
tiller-deploy-f7bd48bf-6x4gh           1/1       Running   0          1m
```

Verify our connection to the `tiller ` pod:

```
$ helm version
Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.9.0", GitCommit:"f6025bb9ee7daf9fee0026541c90a6f557a3e0bc", GitTreeState:"clean"}
Server: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.9.0", GitCommit:"f6025bb9ee7daf9fee0026541c90a6f557a3e0bc", GitTreeState:"clean"}
```

And see that no applications are deployed via `helm`:

```
